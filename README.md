## ‚ùå Description
This web panel is designed to retrieve information from the "api.weather.gov" API, which provides weather *warnings/watched* for various locations. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their desired location and receive real-time weather information. There aren't that many features as of right now and **EXPECT** bugs. Also please don't criticize the UI Design. I know its absolute trash but this will be updated very shortly! This is just a mini-project and not all information may be accurate. (Requested from the *api.weather.gov* API)


## üÜï Features
